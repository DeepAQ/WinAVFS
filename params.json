{"name":"WinAVFS","tagline":"A high-performance Windows virtual filesystem for mounting archives","body":"## What is WinAVFS\r\nWinAVFS is a user-mode Windows filesystem implementation based on Dokan driver. It mounts an archive file (supports all formats supported by 7-Zip) as a read-only volume. To achieve high overall performance, WinAVFS uses unmanaged memory as cached buffer and extracts a file only when it is being read.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\n- [Dokany](https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokany) file system driver [LGPL License]\r\n- [DokanNet](https://github.com/dokan-dev/dokan-dotnet) [MIT License]\r\n- [SevenZipSharp](https://github.com/squid-box/SevenZipSharp) [LGPL License]\r\n- 7z.dll from [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org) [LGPL + unRAR + BSD 3-clause License]\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nTo mount an archive, run the following command:\r\n```\r\n> WinAVFS.CLI.exe <path to archive> <mount point>\r\n```\r\nWhile the application is running, press Ctrl-C to unmount the volume.\r\n\r\n### Mount an archive as a volume with drive letter\r\n```\r\n> WinAVFS.CLI.exe D:\\test.zip Z:\\\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Mount an archive in an NTFS mountpoint\r\n```\r\n> WinAVFS.CLI.exe D:\\test.zip D:\\mount\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\nMIT License\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2020 DeepAQ\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\r\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\r\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\r\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\r\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\r\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\r\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\r\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\r\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
